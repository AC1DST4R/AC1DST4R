# ITS SO NICE TO BE BACK!

## Little sum about me
- Hi! I'm AC1D, Also known as ST4R to some people, That's how I got AC1DST4R. Best of both worlds!
- I handcode all projects (Or just kinda steal ideas 😧)

- But even if I do, It's all recoded to be better, or faster.

## My Promises
- I promise not to:

- Use AI for entire projects
- Have a Repo or a Site that runs like shit
- Advertise to my beautiful people

## "Tf do you mean 'So nice to be back'"

- Due to a false DMCA copyright ban. I was forced off github for a while. Now I'm back with a new account
